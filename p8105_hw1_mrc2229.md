# Taking the mean of the sample for each variable

  - The mean of the sample is 0.0332287 I was able to take the mean of
    this variable because it is a set of numbers.

  - The mean of the sample is 0.5 I was able to take the mean of this
    variable because the logical vector only corresponds to true or
    false, which is coded as zeros and ones.

  - The mean of the sample is NA I was not able to take the mean of this
    variable because it is only characters and no numbers.

  - The mean of the sample is NA I was not able to take the mean of this
    variable because it currently contains no numbers.
