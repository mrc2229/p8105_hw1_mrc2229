# Creating the data frame for problem 1

```{r HW1 Problem1}
library(tidyverse)

set.seed(2)

p8105_hw1_df = tibble(
  h1p1_random_var = rnorm(8),
  h1p1_vec_logical = c(h1p1_random_var>0),
  h1p1_vec_char = c("A","character","variable","that","is", "eight","in", "length"),
  h1p1_vec_factor = factor(c("Low","Low","Low", "Med","Med","High", "High","High"))
)
```

# Taking the mean of the sample for each variable

* The mean of the sample is `r mean(pull(p8105_hw1_df, h1p1_random_var))` 
I was able to take the mean of this variable because it is a set of numbers.

* The mean of the sample is `r mean(pull(p8105_hw1_df, h1p1_vec_logical))` 
I was able to take the mean of this variable because the logical vector only corresponds to true or false, which is coded as zeros and ones.

* The mean of the sample is `r mean(pull(p8105_hw1_df, h1p1_vec_char))` 
I was not able to take the mean of this variable because it is only characters and no numbers. 

* The mean of the sample is `r mean(pull(p8105_hw1_df, h1p1_vec_factor))`
I was not able to take the mean of this variable because it currently contains no numbers.
